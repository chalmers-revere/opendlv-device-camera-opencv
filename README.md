## OpenDLV Microservice to interface with OpenCV-encapsulated cameras

This repository provides source code to interface OpenCV-encapsulated cameras
for the OpenDLV software ecosystem. This microservice provides the captured frames
in two separate shared memory areas, one for a picture in [I420 format](https://wiki.videolan.org/YUV/#I420)
and one in ARGB format.

## Dependencies
You need a C++14-compliant compiler to compile this project. The following
dependency is shipped as part of the source distribution:

* [libcluon](https://github.com/chrberger/libcluon) - [![License: GPLv3](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL--3-blue.svg
)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt)
* [libyuv](https://chromium.googlesource.com/libyuv/libyuv/+/master) - [![License: BSD 3-Clause](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-BSD%203--Clause-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) - [Google Patent License Conditions](https://chromium.googlesource.com/libyuv/libyuv/+/master/PATENTS)


## Usage
This microservice is created automatically on changes to this repository via Docker's public registry for:
* [x86_64](https://hub.docker.com/r/chalmersrevere/opendlv-device-camera-opencv-amd64/tags/)
* [armhf](https://hub.docker.com/r/chalmersrevere/opendlv-device-camera-opencv-armhf/tags/)
* [aarch64](https://hub.docker.com/r/chalmersrevere/opendlv-device-camera-opencv-aarch64/tags/)

To run this microservice using our pre-built Docker multi-arch images to open
an OpenCV-encapsulated camera, simply start it as follows:

```
docker run --rm -ti --init --ipc=host -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY --device /dev/video0 -v /tmp:/tmp chalmersrevere/opendlv-device-camera-opencv-multi:v0.0.11 --camera=/dev/video0 --width=640 --height=480 --freq=20
```

If you want to display the captured frames, simply append `--verbose` to the
commandline above; you might also need to enable access to your X11 server: `xhost +`.

If you want to grab a frame from a capturing device that is producing YUYV422-formatted pixels,
you can pass `--yuyv422` to avoid unnecessary color transformations.

## Build from sources on the example of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
To build this software, you need cmake, C++14 or newer, libopencv-dev
(OpenCV 3 or newer), and make. Having these preconditions, just run `cmake` and
`make` as follows:

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make && make test && make install
```
